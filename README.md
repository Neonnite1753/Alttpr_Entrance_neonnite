This is a Pack for Entrance Randomizer or Crosskeys

Each Location has a capture item that becomes a Badge (small image on the map) when Captured.

When Capturing a location click the Door first in the "Shuffled Loction" section and then the capture item.

I would recomend running with all locations on (F11) as this will keep the badges visable at all times.

I would recomend turning on Fast Tooltips, it makes it quicker to see what each capture location badge means.

To make the badges readable you may need to expand the tracker window as far out as you can, this is due to how the scailing works within emotracker.

When dealing with entrances such as Finding Mimic Cave with no Hammer, Leave the location (Door Icon) in the closed state and capture the item (Hammer in this case) That is required to complete the check. you will be left with accesable (Green) location with a badge of the item required to complete it.

Turn on (Always Allow Chest Manipulation) 

In areas like Mire or Death Mtn right click on the map location for the entrance that you came out of to get there. This will then light up any locations you can check in that area.

Installation:
Normally, an EmoTracker package is installed through the EmoTracker program itself. However, this is a custom pack and not an official subbmission. You will need to manually install it. To install, you will need to perform the following steps:

You will need to modify a settings file in your local EmoTracker working directory, located in C:/Users/<user>/Documents/EmoTracker/application_settings.json. Open this file in your favorite text editor (Notepad if you don't have any).

There is a line labeled "package_repositories": [], you will need to add a link to my repository, which is what informs EmoTracker to download a new update to the tracker package. The resulting line should be "package_repositories": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neonnite1753/Alttpr_Entrance_neonnite/main/repository.json"]. Save the file.

If EmoTracker is open, close and reopen it. From here, the new tracker package should now be a package that shows in the default Package Manager alongside all the other packages you can install. You will see Alttpr Entrance Neonnite as a new option to install.

Click Install. From now on, EmoTracker will show a yellow/green cloud icon when there is a new version of this tracker to install.

Have Fun and Enjoy.
