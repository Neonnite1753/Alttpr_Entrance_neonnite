This is a Pack for Entrance Randomizer or Crosskeys

Each Location has a capture item that becomes a Badge (small image on the map) when Captured.

When Capturing a location click the Door first in the "Shuffled Loction" section and then the capture item.

I would recomend running with all locations on (F11) as this will keep the badges visable at all times.

I would recomend turning on Fast Tooltips, it makes it quicker to see what each capture location badge means.

To make the badges readable you may need to expand the tracker window as far out as you can, this is due to how the scailing works within emotracker.

When dealing with entrances such as Finding Mimic Cave with no Hammer, Leave the location (Door Icon) in the closed state and capture the item (Hammer in this case) That is required to complete the check. you will be left with accesable (Green) location with a badge of the item required to complete it.

Turn on (Always Allow Chest Manipulation) 

In areas like Mire or Death Mtn right click on the map location for the entrance that you came out of to get there. This will then light up any locations you can check in that area.


Have Fun and Enjoy.
